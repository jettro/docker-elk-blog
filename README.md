This repository is almost a complete copy from the excellent ELK Docker config of deviantony:
https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk

Please refer to his repository with questions about installation, extendability, etc. This repo is just here for a blog I have written about creating a robust Logstash implementation. I just needed a docker environment to experiment with LOgstash persistent queue and pipelines.

You can find the blog here:
